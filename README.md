This is a personal penetration testing guide created by myself to organize my perform.

## Find host info


### Network Sweeping

Indentfy active hosts in a netblock
```sh
nmap -v -sn [netblock] -oG [file]
```

Scann on a list of hosts
`-iL [hostfile]`
Nmap will not check if the host is up
`-Pn`
Grappable output
`-oG`

Ex 
```sh
nmap -v -sS -p 80,443 -Pn -iL hosts.txt -oG web-servers.txt
```

### OS Fingerprint
```sh
nmap -v -sO -p 80,3389 -Pn [host] -oG fingerprint.txt
```

### Port mapping methodology [Less noise possible]

TCP host scan
```sh
nmap -v -sS -p- -Pn [host]
```

UDP host scan
```sh
nmap -v -sUV [topports] -Pn [host]
```

### NMAP active hosts
```sh
nmap -sn 11.111.11.1-22
```

## Priviledge escalation

### Find files with SETUID permission
```sh
find / -user root -perm /4000
```

### Check which programs can the actual user run as root
```sh
sudo -l
```
